The main objective of the project is to give farmers the tools and knowledge
they need to better manage their farms, increase their yields and make more
profit of of it. The app offers several modules to help farmers manage their
farms efficiently. The App modules include:
Crop Diagnosis:The app allows farmers to take a photo of a crop and use AI
models to diagnose its condition.
Crop Price Predictions: The app gives farmers access to future predictions
of crop prices to help them make better decisions about their produce
Crop Advisory: The app provides daily crop advisory that includes weather
forecasts, market trends and advice on managing crops.
With respect to the AI/ML model development CNN algorithm was used.
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used in image processing to
detect patterns in objects such as leaves or wilting spots without the need for
explicit manual feature extraction or extensive preprocessing. CNNs are known
to provide highly accurate detection and classification results.
Deep learning models, optimized for the most efficient disease prediction,
will be trained to accurately predict the condition of a crop. A large dataset of
real-world images, historical price data, weather data, agronomic practices, etc.
will be acquired to train a reliable and precise disease prediction model.
